- Implement a RAG system 
- bravia colors bouncing ball ad:

		- A single ball might seem uninteresting or could be taken for granted, meaning #
		 it only has an arrangement of colors and could pas unnoticed by a huge street or a busy
		 neighborhood. 
		 but a thousand balls bouncing downhill create with their spin of colors an arrangement
		 that becomes hard to miss and is seen as a river of color flowing
		 downstream creating multiple patterns as it takes its course.
		 the take from this analogy is that all humans are a multi colored bouncing ball , 
		 diverse and filled with intricate sentiments that sometimes go unnoticed, but that when all 
		 put together to interact with each other, we can see the collective, yet diverse
		 stream of color. ( colors in this case represent emotions )


- Implemented :

Speaker diarization is a technology that automatically identifies and separates different speakers in an audio recording. Let me explain how it works in our system:
What it does:
Automatically detects when different people are speaking
Separates the audio into segments by speaker
Labels each segment with a speaker identifier (like "Speaker A", "Speaker B")
Determines who spoke when and for how long
How it works in our code:
We enable it with speaker_labels=True in the AssemblyAI configuration
AssemblyAI's AI model analyzes the audio and:
Detects voice characteristics
Identifies when the speaker changes
Groups similar voices together
Assigns unique identifiers to each speaker

- the diff sentanalysis:

=== Analysis Results ===

1. Using Transformer-based Analysis (DistilBERT):
   - Faster, more efficient
   - Works offline
   - Best for English text

2. Using LLM-based Analysis (GPT-3.5):
   - More nuanced understanding
   - Better at complex emotions
   - Works with multiple languages

   2. Using LLM-based Analysis (GPT-3.5):
   - More nuanced understanding
   - Better at complex emotions
   - Works with multiple languages

3. A visualization for transformers, and one for LLM

4. statistics of both results 

5. add different ways of gravitas and orbital interactions of bodies within the canvas 

6. map each particle properties like collision, or mass within 3d space.

7. add music reactions , at best if gen ai spacial/analog synth tones , based on collision systems 
	and interaction with other elements of the canvas. plus interactive subtly with mouse interactions
